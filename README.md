# Multi_sensor_object_tracking
Multi-sensor based object tracking using enhanced particle swarm optimized multi-cue granular fusion
we introduced a novel approach for object tracking that can develop an efficient framework of various features from different sensors. If we contemplate a RGB (red–green–blue) image it has better distinction of colors from human eye standpoint but is degraded by shadows and noise caused by illumination. Unlike RGB images thermal images are less receptive to such type of noise factors yet environmental condition can alter its distinction. To overcome this distinction issue of the two sensors a fusion of these two modalities is introduced, considering their interdependent advantages. This proposed technique is focused at enhancing the information collected from the fusion of visible imaging and thermal imaging sensors. It can also be implemented if the number of sensor are increased which in turn increases the number of features.
